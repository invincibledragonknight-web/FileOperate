    Unzip a ZIP archive located inside the workspace.

    This preprocessing function extracts the contents of a ZIP file referenced
    by a virtual workspace path. The archive is unpacked into a directory with
    the same base name as the ZIP file, located in the same workspace directory.

    The function operates strictly within the workspace sandbox:
    - Input paths are virtual (e.g. `/workspace/foo.zip`)
    - Execution is performed on resolved real paths
    - Output paths are returned in virtual-path form for agent consumption

    Typical agent usage:
    - Call this when a ZIP file is detected during workspace inspection
    - Follow with a tree-view operation on the extracted directory

    Args:
        virtual_zip_path: Virtual path to a ZIP file inside the workspace
            (for example `/workspace/datasets/images.zip`). PATH MUST START WITH `/workspace`.

        A dictionary containing:
        - status: Execution status string
        - zip: The input virtual ZIP path
        - extracted_to: Virtual path of the extracted directory
        - num_files: Number of files listed in the ZIP archive

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the ZIP file does not exist.

    Generate a hierarchical tree view of a workspace directory.

    This preprocessing function inspects the directory structure rooted at a
    given virtual workspace path and produces a readable tree representation.
    It is designed for lightweight structural understanding rather than full
    content analysis.

    The function supports depth and entry limits to prevent excessive output
    and is suitable for agent-driven exploration and reporting.

    Typical agent usage:
    - Inspect workspace contents before deciding on further preprocessing
    - Summarize directory layout in reports such as `/final_report.md`
    - Validate results of prior operations such as unzip or file generation

    Args:
        virtual_path: Virtual workspace path to inspect, such as `/workspace`
            or `/workspace/data` PATH MUST START WITH `/workspace`.
        max_depth: Maximum directory depth to traverse. The default value limits
            traversal to a small number of levels to avoid excessive output.
        max_entries: Maximum total number of files or directories to include
            in the output. The default value prevents large directories from
            producing oversized results.

    Returns:
        A dictionary containing:
        - root: The inspected virtual path
